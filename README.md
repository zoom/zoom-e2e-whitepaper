# Zoom End-to-End Encryption Whitepaper
This is the home of the whitepaper documenting Zoom's planned end-to-end encryption system. The latest released PDF will always be [available here](https://github.com/zoom/zoom-e2e-whitepaper/blob/master/zoom_e2e.pdf). This repository will be updated as we implement and iterate our cryptographic design.

See the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for a summary of what changed in each version. We still value
feedback, recommendation and corrections. Please continue to post them under
[Issues](https://github.com/zoom/zoom-e2e-whitepaper/issues).
